# 🧙‍♂️ The Oracle

**The Oracle** is an AI-powered Magic: The Gathering card search experience.

Just describe the card you're imagining — and The Oracle will interpret your words using OpenAI, then find real cards from the multiverse using the Scryfall API.

> Example: _"a red instant that deals damage"_  
> → Interpreted as: `c:r type:instant o:damage`

## 🧙 Why I Built This

I wanted to reimagine what Magic: The Gathering search could feel like — intuitive, magical, and intelligent. The Oracle blends smart UI design with natural language AI to make finding cards effortless and fun. It's also a personal project to explore modern front-end architecture and LLM integrations.
